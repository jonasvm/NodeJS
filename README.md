# NodeJS - Basic CRUD
This is a basic CRUD written in Node JS and Mongo DB. It has the basic operations to create, delete, update and retrieve users, find many users, etc. 
It also uses some code to implement a CLUSTER in Node JS. Although clustering in programming language is not always a good idea, as example it is very cool.
