# NodeJS - Basic CRUD
This is a basic CRUD written in Node JS and Mongo DB. It has the basic operations to create, delete, update and retrieve users, find many users, etc. 

It also uses some code to implement a CLUSTER in Node JS. Although clustering in programming language is not always a good idea, as example it is very cool.

Note: This applicaton has no frontend, it only exposes an endpoint with the services described above.

# Environment Setup

In order to run this CRUD, you need to install Node JS (https://nodejs.org/en/) and Mongo DB (https://www.mongodb.com/download-center) in your machine. 

Once it is not a frontend application, I suggest using Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) to try the service.
